# Blink-2-Voice
Our project focusses on the problems faced by the paralysed people in which they are unable to move their muscles. We try to build an application using Computer Vision to study the pattern of eye blinks and convert them to text for the paralysed people to put forward their thoughts. This application can also send an SMS to the concerned in case of any emergency.
